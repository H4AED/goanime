My efforts to provide a quick and easy anime viewing experience 

## Motivation
I absolutely love watching anime, and I have been using a plethora of different anime sites for years. But recently 
I have been getting rather annoyed about all of the intrusive/ adult content ads, unresponsive webpages, and waiting 
for a long time to just watch a show. Sure I could download scripts so that I can actually use 
Adblock on the sites, but I feel that is a hassell. What if the viewing experience could be quick and easy?
And I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. This repo contains code that provides a quick and 
easy viewing experience. Currently I am using chromedp and headless chrome to get the searched show. 
The code then opens up a new tab in your preferred browser with the selected show. It bypasses any ads 
and gets the show that you want to watch. 

## Contributors 
If you would like to contribute that would be absolutely swell :) !!! I am currently learning Go, as 
I think it is a beautiful language; because of this, the code may not be written in the best way. With this in mind
anyone who has ideas for features or how to improve the code would be greatly appreciated!
